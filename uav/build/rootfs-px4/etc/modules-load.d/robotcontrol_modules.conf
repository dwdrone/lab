# modules required by librobotcontrol
#
# Wthout this file, systemd starts the robotcontrol service before these modules
# have been loaded. rc_startup_routine will still wait until these modules are
# loaded before starting a user's startup project, but this process takes ~20s
# If you are going to fiddle with this file, watch
# /var/log/robotcontrol/startup_log.txt to see if any delays are being caused in 
# the boot sequence as a result. Everything should be loaded by the 9-second point.
# Without this file, the modules do not load until the ~30s point.
